function [offsetsRows, offsetsCols, distances] = templateMatchingIntegralImage(row,...
    col,patchSize, searchWindowSize)
% This function should for each possible offset in the search window
% centred at the current row and col, save a value for the offsets and
% patch distances, e.g. for the offset (-1,-1)
% offsetsX(1) = -1;
% offsetsY(1) = -1;
% distances(1) = 0.125;

% The distance is simply the SSD over patches of size patchSize between the
% 'template' patch centred at row and col and a patch shifted by the
% current offset

% This time, use the integral image method!
% NOTE: Use the 'computeIntegralImage' function developed earlier to
% calculate your integral images
% NOTE: Use the 'evaluateIntegralImage' function to calculate patch sums
